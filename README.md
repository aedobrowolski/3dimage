## 3D Images Done with Type ##

We will generate three dimensional "magic eye" images with plain type. 
The illusion will work if the person stares at the screen and tries
to line up equal letters.  For example: 

```
    I am Joshua D.      I am Joshua D.  
     I am Joshua D.    I am Joshua D.  
      I am Joshua D.  I am Joshua D.  
```

By staring at the blank space between these pairs of sentences, a viewer can 
make the left and right sentences overlap. At that point each line will 
appear to have three sentences and the middle one will 

The point is that we will repeat a pattern but shorten it for closer objects.
